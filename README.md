ALU Design and Simulation Using Icarus Verilog 12.0 on CodeTech Platform "The design of an 8-bit ALU with 2 selective lines using Verilog HDL offers a foundational understanding of how multiple operations can be performed using limited control lines. This design is particularly suited for educational tools like EDA Playground, where users can simulate and verify hardware designs interactively.In this 8-bit ALU design, the unit takes two 8-bit input operands, typically labeled A and B, and processes them based on the values of two select lines, S1 and S0. These select lines determine which operation the ALU will execute. With two select lines, the ALU can support up to four unique operations (2Â² = 4). The output is an 8-bit result, and depending on the operation, additional flags such as carry, zero, or overflow can also be implemented for more advanced designs.The ALU module is written in Verilog, making it synthesizable and suitable for simulation in EDA Playground or FPGA implementation. The module includes inputs for the two operands and select lines, and one output for the result. Internally, a case statement based on the S1 and S0 values determines which operation is executed. This modular and structured approach ensures clarity and maintainability of the code. Task Overview The ALU design involved writing Verilog code to implement basic arithmetic and logic functions such as addition, subtraction, AND, OR, NOT, XOR, and comparison operations. The module accepted two 4-bit inputs (A and B), a 3-bit control signal to select the operation, and provided the result as output along with relevant flags like zero or carry. This was done entirely on the CodeTech platform, which provides a browser-based development environment for hardware description languages (HDLs) like Verilog. The platform allowed me to write, compile, and simulate the code directly in the cloud. Icarus Verilog 12.0 helped me: Compile the Verilog code without syntax errors. Simulate the ALU module using a testbench. Observe the output waveform using a VCD (Value Change Dump) file, viewed in GTKWave. Validate the logical correctness of each operation and identify any design bugs. This process gave me practical insight into how digital circuits are tested before hardware implementation Conclusion The ALU task on CodeTech, combined with the use of Icarus Verilog 12.0, was a valuable learning experience that strengthened my understanding of digital design and HDL simulation. It introduced me to the real-world development workflow of designing and testing processor components. This task not only improved my technical skills but also built confidence in working with industry-standard tools.
